# Background

With advances in instrumentation, we now collect vast multi-omics datasets that provide insights into biological systems and disease mechanisms.
Current methods are often manual and time-consuming.
Our team has developed a scalable deep learning model for multi-omics data harmonization.
We aim to automate interpretation of predictive features using generative AI, thereby speeding up the discovery of biological mechanisms from existing datasets.

# Approach

We will use our harmonization model to identify key features from multi-omics datasets. Subsequently, we will apply Llama 3, fine-tuned with Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) on 'omics-related literature, to interpret these features and elucidate mechanisms driving disease pathogenesis.

# Data Sources

- **Multi-Omics Data**: From PNNL's study on host responses to lethal human viruses.
    - [Publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03124-3)
    - [PNNL DataHub for Multi-onmics Publication](https://data.pnnl.gov/group/nodes/publication/33863)
- **Literature**: â€˜Omics-related publications from PubMed, Medline, and Wikipathways.

# Success Metrics

- **30-day Goal**: Fine-tune Llama 3 with RAFT using relevant literature.
- **60-day Goal**: Demonstrate the model's ability to identify known biological mechanisms.
